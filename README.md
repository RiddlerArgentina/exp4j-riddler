This `exp4j`
----------
This is a **modified** version of `exp4j` which contains changes that will
most likely create problems for regular `exp4j` users.

I will change this fork to fit my specific needs, please use the original
`exp4j` which will always have the latest features, and it will be more stable,
updated, backwards compatible and small (this one is already ~55kb).

`exp4j`
-----

It is a simple-to-use and small library (~40kb) without any external
dependencies.
