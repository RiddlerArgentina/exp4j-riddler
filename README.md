This `exp4j`
----------
This is a **modified** version of [`exp4j`](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j) which 
contains changes that will most likely create problems for regular 
[`exp4j`](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j) users.

I will change this fork to fit my specific needs, consider using the original
[`exp4j`](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j) which will always have the latest features 
and it will be more stable, updated, backwards compatible and small (this one is 
already ~60kb).

[`exp4j`](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j)
-----
[`exp4j`](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j) is a mathematical expression evaluator for
the Java programming language. It is a simple-to-use and small library (~40kb) without 
any external dependencies.
